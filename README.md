The aim of this project is to create a Dapp which allows people around the world to buy and sell an apartment, paying with ethereum or the ETHome cryptocurrency.

This project is open source, and in process of development, any suggestions to improve the project (smart contract suggestions, hardhat test suggestions, and more) are welcome.

Here you can find the following folders:

contracts folder: Here you can find all the contracts developed for the project.

test folder: In this folder are stored the Hardhat test files which ensures the correct working of each method of all the contracts.

ethome-dapp folder: Here is the React app for the user to interact with the contracts.

Feel free to help improve the project as I am on my way to becoming a blockchain developer.
